## NRM Project Year 10 Software Project 
####‘National Railway Museum Steam Exhibition Track System’

Your project is to write a control Programme and simulation for a simple section of railway track shown below. The
drawing is not to scale, and you are to assume the following:

PHASE 1 - A Real Time Railway management System for the National Railway Museum - York Exhibition . Bringing Mallard and
Scotsman to the modern day! Sections A and D are 250 metres long and Sections B and C are 1 kilometre long. All signals
are red and prevent any further movement past them. Signals are located 80 metres before the points Detectors are
located 180 metres before the points. Point A and Point B are set to direct locomotives in Sections A and D into Section
B. Locomotive detectors D1 to D6 are not triggered. There is a locomotive (Scotsman) in Section A and a locomotive (
Mallard) in Section D. The locomotives have a maximum speed of 10Kph and take 10 seconds to reach this speed from a
standing start. They can decelerate from 10Kph to a full stop in 4 seconds.

PHASE 2 - BLACK BOX - in addition to your solution you need to be able to store sensor reaction in to a data file, so the
train company ‘NRM’ can hold valid data to be able to check the detectors, lights and points are not faulty (in the
unlikely event there is a train crash). A Menu program to load and save this file called ‘Blackbox’ will give the user
the option to load, save and adjust the sensor and point settings each time the program runs.

PHASE 3 - Higher level to develop a graphical user interface to monitor train movement through each
sensor sector on the Railway. Your task is to write a programme that will simulate the movement of Mallard to Section A
and Scotsman to Section D in the minimal possible time.
